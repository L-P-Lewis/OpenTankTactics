# Open Tank Tactics
Open Tank Tactics (OTT\) is a Rust port of Luke Muscat's Tank Tactics game, described [here in his 2013 GDC Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9WMNuyjm4w)

OTT seeks to provide a Rust moduel with which to model board states and moves in this game, as well as providing an open HTTP client to allow for asynchronous online play.
